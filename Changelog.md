# Changelog

## v?.?.? &mdash; Coming Soon™

- Merge lift and retract distance settings.
  In practice they should always be the same and the setting was only supported by `.goo`
- Fix auto-layout's previously incorrect handling of scaled and rotated models
- Optimize auto layout (a bit) with NFP bounding box check
- Added anti-aliasing configuration dropdown
- Fix FXAA sampler
- Alow changing XY and Z antialiasing separately
- Added test pattern tool for mslicer debugging / testing
- Fix zero length runs crashing the nanodlp png encoder
- Fix NanoDLP encoder creating invalid results with horizontal dimensions not divisible by three
  - Note that the expected behavior in this case is undefined by the NanoDLP
    documentation, so files sliced with widths that aren't divisible by three
    may not be loadable by other programs.
- Added 'Resin Usage' section to sliced sidebar which shows estimated resin usage, mass, and cost
- Added phonograph record generator
  - mslicer has been my main project for a little while, so I guess anything
    remotely related to resin printing is just getting included in the software.
    But having more features is always good… right?
